# sesdev - deploy and manage SES/Ceph clusters<br/> [![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SUSE/sesdev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SUSE/sesdev) [![Jenkins Build Status](https://ceph-ci.suse.de/job/sesdev-integration/job/master/badge/icon)](https://ceph-ci.suse.de/job/sesdev-integration/job/master/)

`sesdev` is a CLI tool to deploy Ceph clusters (both the upstream and SUSE
downstream versions).

This tool uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) behind the scenes to create
the VMs and run the deployment scripts.

## Installation

First, you should have both [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and
[Libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) installed in some machine to host the VMs
created by sesdev (using Vagrant behind the scenes).

Installable packages for various Linux distributions like Fedora or openSUSE can
be found on the [openSUSE Build Service](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=filesystems%3Aceph&package=sesdev)
(OBS).

### Installation on openSUSE

#### Install KVM/QEMU and Libvirt

```
$ sudo zypper -n install patterns-openSUSE-kvm_server \
patterns-server-kvm_tools bridge-utils
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
$ sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

#### Add user to libvirt group

If you are running libvirt on the same machine where you installed sesdev, add
your user to the "libvirt" group to avoid "no polkit agent available" errors
when vagrant attempts to connect to the libvirt daemon:

```
$ sudo groupadd libvirt
groupadd: group 'libvirt' already exists
$ sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $USER
```

Log out, and then log back in. You should now be a member of the "libvirt"
group.

#### Install Vagrant

sesdev needs Vagrant to work.

```
$ sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/vagrant/<repo> vagrant_repo
$ sudo zypper ref
$ sudo zypper -n install vagrant vagrant-libvirt
```

Where `<repo>` can be any of the openSUSE build targets currently enabled for
the [Virtualization:vagrant/vagrant package in the openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization:vagrant/vagrant).

#### Install sesdev from package

sesdev itself can be installed either from package or from source. If you
prefer to install from package, follow the instructions in this section. If you
prefer to install from source, skip down to the "Install sesdev from source"
section.

```
$ sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems:/ceph/<repo> filesystems_ceph
$ sudo zypper ref
$ sudo zypper install sesdev
```

Where `<repo>` can be any of the openSUSE build targets currently enabled for
the [sesdev package in the openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/filesystems:ceph/sesdev).

At this point, sesdev should be installed and ready to use: refer to the "Usage"
chapter, below, for further information.

### Installation on Fedora Linux

#### Install KVM/QEMU and Libvirt

```
$ sudo dnf install qemu-common qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-kvm \
libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu vagrant-libvirt
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
$ sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

#### Install sesdev from package

```
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo \
https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems:/ceph/<distro>/filesystems:ceph.repo
dnf install sesdev
```

Where `<distro>` can be any of the Fedora build targets currently enabled for
the [sesdev package in the openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/filesystems:ceph/sesdev).

At this point, sesdev should be installed and ready to use: refer to the "Usage"
chapter, below, for further information.

### Install sesdev from source

sesdev itself can be installed either from package or from source. If you
prefer to install from source, follow the instructions in this section. If you
prefer to install from package, scroll up to the "Install sesdev from package"
section for your operating system.

sesdev uses the libvirt API Python bindings, and these cannot be installed via
pip unless the RPM packages "gcc", "python3-devel", and "libvirt-devel" are
installed, first. Also, in order to clone the sesdev git repo, the "git-core"
package is needed. So, before proceeding, make sure that all of these packages
are installed in the system:

```
$ sudo zypper -n install gcc git-core libvirt-devel python3-devel
```

Now you can proceed to clone the sesdev source code repo, create and activate
a virtualenv, and install sesdev's Python dependencies in it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SUSE/sesdev.git
$ cd sesdev
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --editable .
```

Remember to re-run `pip install --editable .` after each git pull.

At this point, sesdev should be installed and ready to use: refer to the "Usage"
chapter, below, for further information.

#### Running the unit tests

If you are preparing a code change for submission and would like to run the
unit tests on it, make sure you have installed sesdev from source, as described
above, and the virtualenv is active. Then, follow the instructions below.

First, install the "tox" package in your system:

```
zypper -n install python3-tox
```

Then, execute the following commands in the top-level of your local git clone
to install the dependencies, including test dependencies:

```
pip install --editable ./[dev]
```

Finally, inspect the list of testing environments in `tox.ini` and choose one or
more that you are interested in. Here is an example, but the actual output might
be different:

```
$ tox --listenvs
py36
py37
lint
```

(This means you have three testing environments to choose from: `py36`, `py37`,
and `lint`.)

Finally, run your chosen test environment(s):

```
tox -e py36
tox -e lint
```

If you don't know which testing environment to choose, the command `tox` will
run *all* the testing environments.

CAVEAT: environments like `py36` and `py37` will only run if that exact version
of Python is installed on your system. So, if you've got Python 3.6 and you
want to run all possible tests:

```
tox -e py36,lint
```

## Usage

Run `sesdev --help` or `sesdev <command> --help` to get the available
options and description of the commands.

### Create/Deploy cluster

To create a single node Ceph cluster based on nautilus/leap-15.1 on your local
system, run the following command:

```
$ sesdev create nautilus --single-node mini
```

The `mini` argument is the ID of the deployment. You can create many deployments
by giving them different IDs.

If you would like to start the cluster VMs on a remote server via libvirt/SSH,
create a configuration file `$HOME/.sesdev/config.yaml` with the following
content:

```
libvirt_use_ssh: true
libvirt_user: <ssh_user>
libvirt_private_key_file: <private_key_file>   # defaults to $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
libvirt_host: <hostname|ip address>
```

Note that passwordless SSH access to this user@host combination needs to be
configured and enabled.

To create a multi-node Ceph cluster, you can specify the nodes and their roles
using the ``--roles`` option.

The roles of each node are grouped in square brackets, separated by commas. The
nodes are separated by commas, too.

The following roles can be assigned:

* `admin` - The admin node, running management components like the Salt master
  or openATTIC (SES5 only)
* `client` - Various Ceph client utilities
* `ganesha` - NFS Ganesha service
* `grafana` - Grafana metrics visualization (requires Prometheus)
* `igw` - iSCSI target gateway
* `mds` - CephFS MDS
* `mgr` - Ceph Manager instance
* `mon` - Ceph Monitor instance
* `prometheus` - Prometheus monitoring
* `rgw` - Ceph Object Gateway
* `storage` - OSD storage daemon
* `suma` - SUSE Manager (octopus only)

The following example will generate a cluster with 4 nodes: the admin node that
is running the salt-master and one MON, two storage nodes that will also run a
MON, a MGR and an MDS, and another node that will run an iSCSI gateway,
nfs-ganesha gateway, and an RGW gateway.

```
$ sesdev create nautilus --roles="[admin, mon], [storage, mon, mgr, mds], \
  [storage, mon, mgr, mds], [igw, ganesha, rgw]" big_cluster
```

#### Custom zypper repos

If you have the URL(s) of custom zypper repo(s) that you would like to add
to all the nodes of the cluster prior to deployment, add one or more
`--repo` options to the command line, e.g.:

```
$ sesdev create nautilus --single-node --repo [URL_OF_REPO] mini
```

By default, the custom repo(s) will be added with an elevated priority,
to ensure that packages from these repos will be installed even if higher
RPM versions of those packages exist. If this behavior is not desired,
add `--no-repo-priority` to disable it.

### Listing deployments

```
$ sesdev list
```

### SSH access to the cluster

```
$ sesdev ssh <deployment_id> [NODE]
```

Spawns an SSH shell to the admin node, or to node `NODE` if explicitly
specified. You can check the existing node names with the following command:

```
$ sesdev show <deployment_id>
```

### Copy files into and out of the cluster

`sesdev` provides a subset of `scp` functionality. For details, see:

```
$ sesdev scp --help
```

### Services port-forwarding

It's possible to use an SSH tunnel to enble TCP port-forwarding for a service
running in the cluster. Currently, the following services can be forwarded:

* dashboard - The Ceph Dashboard (nautilus and above)
* grafana - Grafana metrics dashboard
* openattic - openATTIC Ceph management UI (ses5 only)
* suma - SUSE Manager (octopus only)

```
$ sesdev tunnel <deployment_id> dashboard
```

The command will output the URL that you can use to access the dashboard.

### Stopping a cluster

A running cluster can be stopped by running the following command:

```
$ sesdev stop <deployment_id>
```

### Destroying a cluster

To remove a cluster (both the deployed VMs and the configuration), use the
following command:

```
$ sesdev destroy <deployment_id>
```

It has been reported that vagrant-libvirt sometimes leaves networks behind when
destroying domains (i.e. the VMs associated with a sesdev deployment). If this
bothers you, `sesdev destroy` has a `--destroy-networks` option you can use.

## Common pitfalls

This section describes some common pitfalls and how to resolve them.

### Domain about to create is already taken

#### Symptom

After deleting the `~/.sesdev` directory, `sesdev create` fails because
Vagrant throws an error message containing the words "domain about to create is
already taken".

#### Analysis

As described
[here](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/658#issuecomment-335352340),
this typically occurs when the `~/.sesdev` directory is deleted. The libvirt
environment still has the domains, etc. whose metadata was deleted, and Vagrant
does not recognize the existing VM as one it created, even though the name is
identical.

#### Resolution

As described
[here](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/658#issuecomment-380976825),
this can be resolved by manually deleting all the domains (VMs) and volumes
associated with the old deployment:

```
$ sudo virsh list --all
$ # see the names of the "offending" machines. For each, do:
$ sudo virsh destroy <THE_MACHINE>
$ sudo virsh undefine <THE_MACHINE>
$ sudo virsh vol-list default
$ # For each of the volumes associated with one of the deleted machines, do:
$ sudo virsh vol-delete --pool default <THE_VOLUME>
```

### Storage pool not found: no storage pool with matching name 'default'

#### Symptom

You run `ses create` but it does nothing and gives you a traceback ending with
an error:

```
libvirt.libvirtError: Storage pool not found: no storage pool with matching name 'default'
```

#### Analysis

For whatever reason, your libvirt deployment does not have a default pool
defined. You can verify this by doing:

```
$ sudo virsh pool-list
```

In a working deployment, it says:

```
 Name      State    Autostart
-------------------------------
 default   active   no
```

but in this case the "default" storage pool is missing. (One user hit this when
deploying sesdev on SLE-15-SP1.)

#### Resolution

The "libvirt-daemon" RPM owns a directory `/var/lib/libvirt/images` which is
intended to be associated with the default storage pool:

```
$ sudo rpm -qf /var/lib/libvirt/images
libvirt-daemon-5.1.0-lp151.7.6.1.x86_64
```

Assuming this directory exists and is empty, you can simply create a storage
pool called "default" that points to this directory, and the issue will be
resolved:

```
$ sudo virsh pool-define /dev/stdin <<EOF
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>default</name>
  <target>
    <path>/var/lib/libvirt/images</path>
  </target>
</pool>
EOF
$ sudo virsh pool-start default
$ sudo virsh pool-autostart default
```

[his post here](https://github.com/simon3z/virt-deploy/issues/8#issuecomment-73111541)

### When sesdev deployments get destroyed, virtual networks get left behind

#### Symptom

You create and destroy a sesdev deployment, perhaps even several
times, and then you notice that virtual networks get left behind. For example,
after several create/destroy cycles on deployment "foo":

```
$ sudo virsh net-list
 Name              State    Autostart   Persistent
----------------------------------------------------
 foo0              active   yes         yes
 foo1              active   yes         yes
 foo10             active   yes         yes
 foo2              active   yes         yes
 foo3              active   yes         yes
 foo4              active   yes         yes
 foo5              active   yes         yes
 foo6              active   yes         yes
 foo7              active   yes         yes
 foo8              active   yes         yes
 foo9              active   yes         yes
 vagrant-libvirt   active   no          yes
```

#### Analysis

It has been reported that vagrant-libvirt sometimes leaves networks behind when
it destroys domains (i.e. the VMs associated with a sesdev deployment). We do
not currently know why, or under what conditions, this happens.

#### Resolution

If this behavior bothers you, `sesdev destroy` has a `--destroy-networks` option
you can use. Of course, `sesdev destroy --destroy-networks` only works for the
network(s) associated with the VMs in the deployment being destroyed. To quickly
destroy a bunch of networks, construct a script like so:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -r -d '' NETZ <<EOF
foo0
foo1
foo2
foo3
foo4
foo5
foo6
foo7
foo8
foo9
foo10
EOF
for net in $NETZ ; do
    virsh net-destroy $net
    virsh net-undefine $net
done
```

The script should be run as root on the libvirt server.
